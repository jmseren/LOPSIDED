It has an emphasis on substance and building, rather than the hype of investing. \n\nWe will initially use founders that we've invested in as guests, but expand to other founders that we want to build relationships with as well. \n\nGiven this, please help us with creating a show outline, potential intro/outro script, and whatever else we may need to get started in creating a podcast like summaries, descriptions etc.\n\nThe audience is people in early stage tech, venture investors, and people generally interested in startups.",

In a tree, the elements are organized into a hierarchical structure, with a single root element at the top, and other elements branching off from it. Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order. For example, if element A is the parent of element B, and element B is the parent of element C, then elements A and C are considered to be equal to each other according to the antisymmetric property.",

Event on nuclear energy in Australia, referring to Australia's current ban on nuclear energy, concerns about grid stability and baseload capacity under renewables, and the fact that it is in the news at the moment, but apparently not on the table, politically. The discussion will focus more on the socio-political context, rather than standard arguments for her against nuclear energy, considering what Australians think collectively, not individually, and how we come to discover and understand what that collective thought is, which must not be \u2018groupthink\u2019, and whether nuclear energy has now in 21st century Australia become a potentially unifying and engaging issue, not a divisive issue as in the late 20th century, and whether the current generation of 50-somethings and 60-somethings who are now running the country (govt, business, academia) have been very slow to realise this.",

This marked a departure from previous proprietary text-to-image models such as DALL-E and Midjourney which were accessible only via cloud services.[",
